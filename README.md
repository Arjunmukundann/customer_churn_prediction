# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a company's services) using machine learning techniques. By identifying potential churners early, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them and reduce customer attrition.


## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Customer churn is a key metric for businesses, especially those operating on a subscription or service-based model. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a customer will churn or not based on various features like customer demographics, service usage patterns, and account information.
